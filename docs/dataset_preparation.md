## Dataset Preparation

Please refer to [segmentator](https://github.com/Karbo123/segmentator.git) to get mesh segmentator.
You should clone the repository in the folder 'data', and it will be imported in 'batch_load_scannet_data.py' for generating mesh segmentation results.

For each dataset, you should first process the reconstructed dataset, which is the dataset without the `-SV` or `-MV` suffix. This dataset is used for model evaluation.
